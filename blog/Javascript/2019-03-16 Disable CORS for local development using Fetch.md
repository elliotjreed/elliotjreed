# Disable CORS for development with Fetch

If you're developing on your local computer in Javascript and using `fetch` you'll probably have issues with cross-origin requests (CORS) if you're talking to another local API on your computer.

There are many ways of getting around this, but the easiest is perhaps to use a browser extension to ignore CORS.

For Chrome or Chromium use: [chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi)

For Firefox use: [addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/cors-everywhere/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/cors-everywhere/)
